# Vaani

Vaani is a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication framework inspired by Nostr. Unlike traditional centralized platforms, Vaani aims to facilitate truly decentralized and uniform implementation of secure communication protocols. With a focus on simplicity and interoperability, it enables users to exchange messages and data seamlessly while ensuring privacy and security.

## Features

- **Decentralized Communication**: Operates without a central authority, enabling peer-to-peer message exchange.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Utilizes modern cryptographic techniques for key generation, message signing, and encryption.
- **Flexible Data Structures**: Supports customizable templates for posts, metadata, and messages.
- **Proof of Work**: Includes difficulty-based verification to ensure computational integrity.
- **Uniform Implementation**: Provides a single, consistent implementation to avoid fragmentation.
- **Built-in Templates**: Simplifies the creation of posts and metadata with predefined templates.
